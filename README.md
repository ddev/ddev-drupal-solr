## What is the difference between this and ddev-solr

Please consider using [ddev/ddev-solr](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-solr), which runs Solr in the modern "cloud" mode. This offers several advantages. If you are using Drupal, the biggest advantage
is that you can update the Solr Configset from the UI or with a Drush command everytime you update search_api_solr.

The current addon runs in "classic standalone" mode. It is probably simpler at first to setup, but comes with the added maintainance steps for configsets. Most Solr hosting service providers run "Solr Cloud"
as a backend.

## What is this?

This repository allows you to quickly install Apache Solr for Drupal 9+ into a [Ddev](https://ddev.readthedocs.io) project using just `ddev add-on get ddev/ddev-drupal-solr`. It follows the [Setting up Solr (single core) - the classic way](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/search_api_solr/-/blob/4.x/README.md#setting-up-solr-single-core-the-classic-way) recipe.

## Installation on Drupal 9+

1. Install this add-on: `ddev add-on get ddev/ddev-drupal-solr && ddev restart`
2. You may need to install the relevant Drupal requirements: `ddev composer require drush/drush drupal/search_api_solr`
3. Enable the `search_api_solr` module either using the web interface or `ddev drush en -y search_api_solr`
4. Create a Search API server at `admin/config/search/search-api` -> "Add server"
5. Configure the server with the following settings:
   * Set "Server name" to anything you want. Maybe `ddev-solr-server`.
   * Set "Backend" to `Solr`
   * Configure Solr backend
     * Set "Solr Connector" to `Standard`
     * Set "Solr host" to `solr`
     * Set "solr core" to `dev`
     * Under "Advanced server configuration" set the "solr.install.dir" to `/opt/solr`.
6. Restart Ddev: `ddev restart`.

## Installation on Drupal 7

### Ddev / Solr configuration

1. Install this add-on: `ddev add-on get ddev/ddev-drupal-solr`
2. Set the version of Solr verison 7: Edit the `.ddev/docker-compose.solr.yaml` file. Replace `image: solr:8` with `image: solr:7` on line 34.
3. Add the schema needed for version 7: Defaults can be found in the Search API Solr in the `search_api_solr/solr-conf/7.x` directory . Copy these files into `.ddev/solr/conf`.
4. Restart Ddev: `ddev restart`.
5. Confirm Solr is working by visiting `http://<projectname>.ddev.site:8983/solr/`.

6. If the Ddev drush version is too new for Drupal 7, you may need to symlink `drush` to the `drush8` provided with Ddev. You can do this by adding a `post-start` hook inside your `.ddev/config.yaml` file as follows
  ```
  hooks:
    post-start:
    - exec: ln -s /usr/local/bin/drush8 /usr/local/bin/drush
  ```
7. Restart Ddev: `ddev restart`.

### Drupal configuration

1. You may need to install the relevant Drupal modules: `ddev drush dl search_api_solr`.
2. Enable the `search_api_solr` module either using the web interface or `ddev drush en -y search_api_solr`
4. Create a Search API server at `admin/config/search/search-api` -> "Add server"
5. Configure the server with the following settings:
   * Set "Server name" to anything you want. Maybe `ddev-solr-server`.
   * Set "Protocol" to `http`
   * Set "Solr host" to `solr`
   * Set "Solr port" to `8983`
   * Set "path" to `/solr/dev`.
   The "Solr server URI" should be `http://solr:8983/solr/dev` when done.
6. Create a Search API index at `admin/config/search/search-api` -> "Add index"
7. Configure the index as needed, but this is common:
   * Set "Server name" to anything you want. Maybe `ddev-solr-index-content`.
   * Set "item type" to `content`
   * Set the server to `ddev-solr-server` (or whaver the name is)
   * Index the site.
8. Build a new view of indexed content `ddev-solr-index-content` (or whatever the name is)
7. Configure the view as needed.


## Outdated Solr config files

If you get a message about Solr having outdated config files, you need to update the included Solr config files.

### Drupal 9+:

1. Click "Get config.zip" on the server page
2. Unzip the files, and put the config files into `.ddev/solr/conf/`
3. Restart Ddev: `ddev restart`

### Drupal 7

1. Locate the example files in the `search_api_solr/solr-conf/7.x` directory .
2. Copy these files into `.ddev/solr/conf`.
4. Restart Ddev: `ddev restart`.

### Other frameworks

See [the documentation in the `doc` folder](doc/README.md)

## Explanation

This is the classic Drupal `solr:8` image recipe used for a long time by Drupal users and compatible with `search_api_solr`.

* This add-on installs a [`.ddev/docker-compose.solr.yaml`](docker-compose.solr.yaml) using the `solr:8` docker image.
* A standard Drupal 9+ Solr configuration is included in [.ddev/solr/conf](solr/conf).
* A [.ddev/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/solr-configupdate.sh](solr/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/solr-configupdate.sh) is included and mounted into the Solr container so that you can change Solr config in `.ddev/solr/conf` with just a `ddev restart`.

## Interacting with Apache Solr

* The Solr admin interface will be accessible at: `http://<projectname>.ddev.site:8983/solr/` For example, if the project is named `myproject` the hostname will be: `http://myproject.ddev.site:8983/solr/`.
* To access the Solr container from inside the web container use: `http://solr:8983/solr/`
* A Solr core is automatically created by default with the name "dev"; it can be accessed (from inside the web container) at the URL: `http://solr:8983/solr/dev` or from the host at `http://<projectname>.ddev.site:8983/solr/#/~cores/dev`. You can obviously create other cores to meet your needs.

## Alternate Core Name

If you want to use a core name other than the default "dev", add a `.ddev/docker-compose.solr-env.yaml` with these contents, using the core name you want to use:

```yml
services:
  solr:
    environment:
    - SOLR_CORENAME=somecorename
```
1. Change SOLR_CORENAME environment variable in the `environment:` section.
2. Change your Drupal configuration to use the new core.

You can delete the "dev" core from `http://<projectname>.ddev.site:8983/solr/#/~cores/dev` by clicking "Unload".

## Caveats

* This recipe is designed for versions of Solr `solr:8` and beyond. Acquia's hosting [requires Solr 7](https://docs.acquia.com/acquia-search/). You'll want to follow the Drupal 7 instructions above, or see the [contributed recipes](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-contrib) for older versions of Solr.
