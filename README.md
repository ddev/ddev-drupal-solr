## What is this?

This repository allows you to quickly install Apache Solr for Drupal 9+ into a [Ddev](https://ddev.readthedocs.io) project using just `ddev get ddev/ddev-drupal9-solr`. It follows the [Setting up Solr (single core) - the classic way](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/search_api_solr/-/blob/4.x/README.md#setting-up-solr-single-core-the-classic-way) recipe.

## Installation on Drupal 9+

1. `ddev get ddev/ddev-drupal9-solr && ddev restart`
1. You may need to install the relevant Drupal requirements: `ddev composer require drush/drush:* drupal/search_api_solr`
1. Enable the `search_api_solr` module either using the web interface or `ddev drush en -y search_api_solr`
1. Create a search_api server at `admin/config/search/search-api` -> "Add server"
1. Create a server with the following settings
   * Set "Server name" to anything you want. Maybe `ddev-solr-server`.
   * Set "Backend" to `Solr`
   * Configure Solr backend
     * Set "Solr Connector" to `Standard`
     * Set "Solr host" to `solr`
     * Set "solr core" to `dev`
     * Under "Advanced server configuration" set the "solr.install.dir" to `/opt/solr`.

1. `ddev restart`

## Explanation

This is the classic Drupal `solr:8` image recipe used for a long time by Drupal users and compatible with `search_api_solr`.

* It installs a [`.ddev/docker-compose.solr.yaml`](docker-compose.solr.yaml) using the solr:8 docker image.
* A standard Drupal 9+ Solr configuration is included in [.ddev/solr/conf](solr/conf).
* A [.ddev/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/solr-configupdate.sh](solr/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/solr-configupdate.sh) is included and mounted into the Solr container so that you can change Solr config in `.ddev/solr/conf` with just a `ddev restart`.

## Interacting with Apache Solr

* The Solr admin interface will be accessible at: `http://<projectname>.ddev.site:8983/solr/` For example, if the project is named `myproject` the hostname will be: `http://myproject.ddev.site:8983/solr/`.
* To access the Solr container from inside the web container use: `http://solr:8983/solr/`
* A Solr core is automatically created by default with the name "dev"; it can be accessed (from inside the web container) at the URL: `http://solr:8983/solr/dev` or from the host at `http://<projectname>.ddev.site:8983/solr/#/~cores/dev`. You can obviously create other cores to meet your needs.

## Alternate Core Name

If you want to use a core name other than the default "dev", add a `.ddev/docker-compose.solr-env.yaml` with these contents, using the core name you want to use:

```
services:
  solr:
    environment:
    - SOLR_CORENAME=somecorename
```

1. Remove the #ddev-generated at the top of the file.
2. Change SOLR_CORE environment variable in the `environment:` section.
3. Change your Drupal configuration to use the new core.

## Caveats

* This recipe won't work with versions of Solr before `solr:8`, and Acquia and Pantheon.io hosting require versions from 3 to 7. You'll want to see the [contributed recipes](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-contrib) for older versions of solr.
